### Cryptocurrencies
###### Overview
This project was created to help familiarize me with unsupervised machine learning. The data that was used was from cryptocurrencies. 
The first step was to process the data in order to make it suitable for PCA (Principal Component Analysis). Then using PCA to create three principal components
and elbow plots I created clusters. Then I created scatter plots to visualize these clusters. Attached is the 2-d version of the plot that was created
